# Multiply Game
To engage with the game, simply download the files and execute the HTML file, or alternatively, access it directly at https://digiruori.fi/pelit/r6p2/.

This game, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was commissioned by teachers seeking a multiplication-focused educational tool for eight-year-old students. Throughout the project, our team of five efficiently managed tasks using KanbanFlow, organizing the development into five sprints, each lasting one week.
